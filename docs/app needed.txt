Awesome — looks like you’re ready to roll on the **AI-powered dating app: Neural Hearts**. The documentation you uploaded gives a solid foundation. Here's a breakdown of how we can start developing it step-by-step, and you can let me know what you’d like to dive into first:

---

### 🚀 PHASE 1: Planning & Design (Month 1–2)

**✅ Done:** Market research & concept documentation (your doc is solid!)

**Next up:**
- [ ] **Wireframing/UI design**
- [ ] **Database schema planning**
- [ ] **App architecture blueprint**

Would you like help designing the **UI/UX** (we can use Figma mockups or HTML prototypes)? Or should we start mapping out the **backend structure and API routes**?

---

### 🛠 PHASE 2: MVP Development (Month 3–5)

We'll use:

#### 👨‍💻 **Frontend**
- React Native + TailwindCSS (via `tailwind-rn`)
- Redux for state

#### 🧠 **Backend**
- Node.js + Express
- PostgreSQL or MongoDB (you can choose based on flexibility vs structure)
- Firebase for auth/OTP

#### 🤖 **AI/ML (Python-based)**
- scikit-learn/TensorFlow for matchmaking
- Face recognition + NLP for chat

---

### 🔐 KEY MODULES TO START WITH

1. **Authentication**
   - Firebase login (phone/email)
   - Profile creation (with video upload option)

2. **AI Matchmaking**
   - User preferences
   - Interests matching model (basic version)

3. **Messaging System**
   - Real-time chat (can use Socket.io)
   - Blind mode toggle

---

### So tell me...

What do you want to start with?

- 🔲 Wireframes (we sketch the UI/UX flow)
- 🔲 React Native setup with basic login
- 🔲 Database schema (users, matches, chats, etc.)
- 🔲 AI matching logic (Python starter code)
- 🔲 Something else?

Once you choose, I’ll generate code/templates and help you build it piece by piece.
